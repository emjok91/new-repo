As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to generate a PDF file. However, in a real-world scenario, the file "backend/app/api/templates/template2.pdf" would be a pre-existing PDF document that serves as a template for filling out with extracted information from the medical clinic letters. This file would be created manually using a PDF editor and then placed in the specified directory.
