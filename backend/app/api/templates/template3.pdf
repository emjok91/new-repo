As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to generate binary files such as PDFs. The file "backend/app/api/templates/template3.pdf" would be a PDF file, which is a binary format and cannot be generated through this text-based interface. You would need to create this file manually using a PDF editor or generator. The content of the PDF would be a predefined template for a specific type of medical task, as per your application's requirements.
