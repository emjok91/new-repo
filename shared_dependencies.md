Shared Dependencies:

1. Django and Django REST Framework: All the files in the Django app share the Django framework as a dependency. Django REST Framework is used in views.py and serializers.py files across all apps for creating RESTful APIs.

2. PostgreSQL: Used in settings.py for database configuration. It's also indirectly used in all models.py files across all apps where the database schema is defined.

3. PyPDF2 and PDFMiner.six: These libraries are used in the file_processing app for extracting text from PDF files.

4. spaCy, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face Transformers: These are used in the task_extraction app for named entity recognition and task extraction.

5. Celery: Used in the file_processing and task_extraction apps for asynchronous task processing.

6. pytest: Used in all tests.py files across all apps for testing the application.

7. Docker and Docker Compose or Kubernetes: Used in Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml or Kubernetes configuration files for containerization and orchestration.

8. File and Folder Names: The names of the folders like 'media', 'static', 'templates' are shared across the application for file storage and template management.

9. Model Names: The names of the models defined in models.py files are shared across the application as they represent the database schema.

10. View Function Names: The names of the view functions defined in views.py files are shared across the application as they represent the application's endpoints.

11. URL Names: The names of the URLs defined in urls.py files are shared across the application as they represent the application's routes.

12. Serializer Names: The names of the serializers defined in serializers.py files are shared across the application as they are used for data serialization and deserialization.

13. Admin Configuration: The admin.py files across all apps share the Django admin configuration.

14. Error Handling: The error_handling app shares its functionality with all other apps for robust error handling and logging.
