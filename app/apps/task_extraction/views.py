    @action(detail=True, methods=['post'])
    def extract(self, request, pk=None):
        task = self.get_object()
        try:
            tasks = extract_tasks(task.file.path)
            return Response({'status': 'success', 'tasks': tasks})

```
This code defines a Django REST Framework viewset for the Task model. It includes a custom action that triggers the task extraction process when a POST request is made to the `extract` endpoint of a specific task. The `extract_tasks` function is assumed to be defined in a `services.py` file in the same directory, and is responsible for performing the actual task extraction using spaCy, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face Transformers. The extracted tasks are returned in the response. If an error occurs during the extraction process, an error message is returned with a 500 status code.
