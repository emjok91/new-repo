// This file is intentionally left blank as it's not common to have an __init__.js file in JavaScript or React projects.
// The __init__.py files are used in Python to indicate to the Python interpreter that the directory should be treated as a Python package.
// In JavaScript or React, the index.js file often plays a similar role, serving as the entry point for a directory.
